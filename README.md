Project Overview: This project is a specialized data mining tool designed to aggregate global educational data into a structured format. It automates the discovery and collection of university details, making it a valuable tool for academic research and global education analysis.

Technical Features:

Automated Web Scraper (the_scraper.py): A robust engine that navigates through web sources to harvest real-time data about international universities.

Web Interface (university_list_app.py): A Python-based application that renders the collected data into a user-friendly web page for easy browsing.

Multi-Format Export: Features functionality to export the entire dataset into Excel (universities_list.xlsx) for offline analysis and reporting.

Data Accuracy: Focused on capturing key university information, including names, locations, and other relevant academic metadata.

Technical Stack:

Language: Python (100%).

Core Components: Scraping libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup or Scrapy), Web Framework (e.g., Flask or Streamlit), and Data Handling (Pandas).
